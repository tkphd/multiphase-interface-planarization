# Multiphase Interface Planarization

T칩th *et al.* (*Physical Review B* **92** (2015) 184105) reviewed competing
multiphase-field models for thermodynamic consistency and kinetic stability of planar
interfaces at equilibrium. This repository contains multiphase-field models intended for
evolution of multiphase systems with pairwise-asymmetric interfacial properties. The
example codes demonstrate equilibration of the planar binary interface produced upon
collapse of a ternary system with one phase encapsulated within a circular domain
(grain). The models are based on the excellent write-up in Ref. 1, with specific details
in further references. Contour plots of bulk free energy potentials for a sampling of the
models discussed are generated by `simplex.py`. Numerical simulations for three of the
most popular/significant/relevant models are implemented in the subdirectories using
[MMSP](https://github.com/mesoscale/mmsp).
