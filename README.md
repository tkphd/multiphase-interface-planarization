# Trijunction Drag
A recent paper (*Physical Review B* **92** (2015) 184105) reviewed competing
multiphase-field models for thermodynamic consistency and kinetic stability
of planar interfaces at equilibrium. Contour plots of bulk free energy potentials
for a sampling of the models discussed are generated in simplex.py. Numerical
simulations for three of the most popular/significant/relevant models are
implemented in the subdirectories using [MMSP](https://github.com/mesoscale/mmsp).
