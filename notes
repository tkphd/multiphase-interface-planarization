This directory contains multiphase-field models intended for evolution of
multiphase systems with pairwise-asymmetric interfacial properties. The
example codes demonstrate equilibration of the planar binary interface
produced upon collapse of a ternary system with one phase encapsulated
within a circular domain (grain). The models are based on the excellent
write-up in Ref. 1, with specific details in further references.
